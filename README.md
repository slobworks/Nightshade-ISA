Starting with v0.8a, the VFC should conform to the official schematics provided by Cirrus Logic.
Version 0.8 had a broken VFC altogether with a missing signal and wacked out assignments, these issues have been fixed starting with 0.8a.

As you can see I'm a bit of a neophyte when it comes to this GitHub stuff.
Expect this to change as I become more familiar with the platform.
