NIGHTSHADE v0.8 - Public Domain Cirrus Logic CL-GD542x Based ISA VGA Card

As it says on the package. This card supports a maximum memory size of 1MB, using traditional multiple-CAS FPM 256Kx16 SOJ memory. 70ns or faster is recommended.
Created using KiCAD 8.0.

Features:
- Four layer PCB with generous stitching vias for maximum possible signal integrity
- Compatible with most members of the CL-GD542x family
- Uses 29C010-compatible flash memory for reduced cost; has options to select one of four 32K banks within the large 128K flash memory if you wish to try multiple video BIOSes
- Features my own hand-drawn artwork on back of board
- Ready to go: just drag and drop the .ZIP file on your PCB fab of choice

If for some reason you only want 512K of memory, then populate U2 only. Otherwise fit both U2 and U3 for a full 1MB memory.

As you can see I'm a bit of a neophyte when it comes to this GitHub stuff.
Expect this to change as I become more familiar with the platform.
