NIGHTSHADE v0.8b2 - Public Domain Cirrus Logic CL-GD542x Based ISA VGA Card

As it says on the package. This card supports a maximum memory size of 1MB or 2MB, depending on the chip you use, using traditional multiple-CAS FPM 256Kx16 SOJ memory. 70ns or faster is recommended.
Created using KiCAD 8.0.

Features:
- Four layer PCB with generous stitching vias for maximum possible signal integrity
- Supports 1MB of memory with CL-GD5424, or 2MB with CL-GD5426/5428/5429
- Compatible with the N-well variants of the CL-GD542x, including the CL-GD5424, GD5426, GD5428 and GD5429
- Uses 29C010-compatible flash memory for reduced cost; has options to select one of four 32K banks within the large 128K flash memory if you wish to try multiple video BIOSes
- Features my own hand-drawn artwork on back of board

Release History:
- 0.8a: Fixed VESA Feature Connector pinout, now conforms to Cirrus datasheet
- 0.8b: Resolved a number of issues related to VGA output quality (no more wavy interference onscreen!), and reduced the parts count a bit. Fewer parts means less $$ spent, and less breathing of solder fumes.
- 0.8b2: Changed LM334SM to the _much_ cheaper LM334M.

Released into the Public Domain. Use whatever license floats your boat on your own edits.

As you can see I'm a bit of a neophyte when it comes to this GitHub stuff.
Expect this to change as I become more familiar with the platform.
